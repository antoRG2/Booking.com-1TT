This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what you’re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. JQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required. Please do not use jQuery plugins. Also avoid frameworks like
Angular and Backbone. Please make sure the page works as a static page without
the need to run a web server or a build script.

First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
6-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.

Second, pick at least two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever tasks you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.
Browser support should include IE8+, Chrome, Safari, FF.

Tasks
========================================

 *  Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.
 	Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page.

**********************************************
a. Tasks Order 

1. "Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.
 	Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page."
This one is definitely the most important in the list because this task add worth to the site. The design could be simple as far as the site be functional and the content attractive for the users   

2. "Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score."
Pagination will make the page look more attractive to the user. Show information in smaller blocks keeps the user interested and make the site look more clean and organized 

3. "Improve the facilities block." 
As same as point #2, once the site is functional, this tasks improve the look and feel of the site, giving a more organized vision of the page 

4. "Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and
 	some nearby landmarks."
Considering the business line of the page, after make the page functional and gave it a cleaner style, implement maps and landmarks feature is worthy enough for the user.

5. "Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Include an automatic	slideshow mode, add prev/next
	buttons to manually control the carousel, add a layer that shows the
	contents of the images alt text."
This feature gives a visual attractive to the page, it doesn't affect functionality or the clean of the page but make it showy

6.  "Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy
 	or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display
 	additional information about rooms."
This tasks will be useful for the user but is a nice to have in the page because doesn't represent an advantage for the site or an innovation in the functionality
